Create your first AI agent step-by-step. No coding required.

This will use a template to build a **Meeting Prep Assistant** that:
- Checks your calendar for upcoming meetings.
- Finds relevant emails about those meetings.
- Creates a summary document with key discussion points.

Feel free to follow along with this example or customize the instructions and tools for your own agent needs.

You'll interact with your agent through chat, just like texting a helpful assistant.

## Before you start

You'll need:
- A LangSmith account ([sign up here](https://smith.langchain.com)).
- A Gmail account.
- A Google Calendar.
- An OpenAI or Anthropic API key (Step 1 will show you how to get one).

## Step 1. Get your API key

Your agent needs an API key to connect to an AI model. The AI model is what allows your agent to understand and respond to your requests.

  <Tab title="OpenAI (ChatGPT)">
    1. Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
    1. Click **Create new secret key**.
    1. Give it a name like "Agent Builder".
    1. Copy the key (it starts with `sk-`).
    1. Save it somewhere safe, you'll need it in Step 2.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Anthropic (Claude)">
    1. Go to [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
    2. Click **Create Key**.

    5. Save it somewhere safe, you'll need it in Step 2.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
**Cost:** Both services charge based on use.
</Info>

## Step 2. Add your API key to LangSmith

Now you'll add your API key to LangSmith so your agents can use it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    1. Go to [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com).
    2. Click the <Icon icon="gear" /> **Settings** icon in the bottom left.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Secrets">
    Click the **Secrets** tab at the top.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your key">
    1. Click **Add secret**.
    2. For **Key**, enter:
       - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (if using OpenAI)
       - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (if using Anthropic)
    3. For **Value**, paste the API key you copied in Step 1.
    4. Click **Save secret**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success" icon="check" color="#10B981" iconType="regular">
Your agent now has access to an AI model to understand and respond to your requests. Next, you'll create your agent.
</Callout>

## Step 3. Create your agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Agent Builder">
    1. In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), click the <Icon icon="mouse-pointer"/> no-code toggle in the lower left-hand navigation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a template">
    1. Select **Templates** in the left-hand navigation.
    1. Select **Email Assistant** template.
    1. Click **Use this template**.

    <Tip>
    If you don't want to start with a template, you have two other options. From the **+ New Agent** page:
    - Use the chat interface to describe your agent, and it will help you create it step-by-step.
    - Select **Create manually instead** to build your agent without any pre-filled responses on the configuration page.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize accounts">
    Your agent will ask you to connect your Google accounts:

    1. Click **Connect**.
    2. Sign in with your Google account.
    3. Review permissions and click **Allow**.
    4. You'll be redirected back to LangSmith where your agent will be created.
  </Step>

</Steps>

<Info>
Your agent only accesses your accounts when working on tasks you give it. You can revoke access anytime in your Google account settings.
</Info>

## Step 4. Customize your agent

<Steps>

  <Step title="Customize for meeting prep">

    1. When you use a template, you may want to edit the title and description at the top of the configuration page.
    2. Update the **Instructions** field with the following:

        ```
        You are a Meeting Prep Assistant. When I ask you to help me prepare for meetings:

        1. Check my Google Calendar for meetings today or tomorrow
        2. For each meeting, search my Gmail for emails about that meeting (use meeting title keywords)
        3. Create a summary document with:
           - Meeting name, time, and attendees
           - Key topics from emails
           - Any action items or decisions mentioned
        4. Ask me if I want you to send this summary to myself via email

        Always confirm before sending emails.
        ```

    3. Click **Save Changes**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a test chat">
    1. In the right-hand panel of the configuration page, select the **Test Chat** tab.
    2. Try out the email assistant in the chat interface:

    > _Help me prepare for my meetings today_
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent starts working">
    Your agent will start work and provide a **Continue** option for each step that requires your approval.

    <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/langsmith/images/agent-builder-response.png"
    alt="Test chat output view with response including approvals for Gmail tool."
    />

    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/langsmith/images/agent-builder-response-dark.png"
    alt="Test chat output view with response including approvals for Gmail tool."
    />

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5. Review and approve

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the summary">
    Your agent will present a meeting prep summary in chat. Review it for accuracy.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Give feedback (optional)">
    If something isn't working well, tell your agent. For example:

    > _Can you also include links to the emails you found?_

    Your agent will update the summary.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve email send (if applicable)">
    If your agent asks to send the summary via email, you'll see:

    **"I'd like to send this summary to you. Do you approve?"**

    Click **Approve** or **Edit** to modify before sending.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Edit your agent

You may want to update your agent's instructions or include more tools. You can directly chat with your agent to ask for updates, or you can:

1. From **My Agents** in the left-hand navigation, select your **Meeting Prep Assistant** agent.
1. Select <Icon icon="pencil"/> **Edit Agent**.

    <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/langsmith/images/agent-builder-edit-page.png"
    alt="Agent in edit mode with a visualization and options to add tools, sub-agents, and triggers."
    />

    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/langsmith/images/agent-builder-edit-page-dark.png"
    alt="Agent in edit mode with a visualization and options to add tools, sub-agents, and triggers."
    />

From the agent's edit page, you can:

- Add tools with **+ Add tool** to connect more apps and services like Slack, GitHub, or Linear.
- Add further helpers with **+ Add sub-agent** to break complex tasks into specialized sub-tasks.
- Request pauses for reviews on existing tools.
- Modify existing tools.
- Explore features that can trigger your agent to start a task.
