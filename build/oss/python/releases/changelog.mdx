<Update label="Nov 25, 2025">
    ## v1.1.0

    * [Model profiles](/oss/python/langchain/models#model-profiles): Chat models now expose supported features and capabilities through a `.profile` attribute. These data are derived from [models.dev](https://models.dev), an open source project providing model capability data.
    * [Summarization middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#summarization): Updated to support flexible trigger points using model profiles for context-aware summarization.
    * [Structured output](/oss/python/langchain/structured-output): `ProviderStrategy` support (native structured output) can now be inferred from model profiles.
    * [`SystemMessage` for `create_agent`](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/custom#working-with-system-messages): Support for passing `SystemMessage` instances directly to `create_agent`'s `system_prompt` parameter, enabling advanced features like cache control and structured content blocks.
    * [Model retry middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#model-retry): New middleware for automatically retrying failed model calls with configurable exponential backoff.
    * [Content moderation middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#content-moderation): OpenAI content moderation middleware for detecting and handling unsafe content in agent interactions. Supports checking user input, model output, and tool results.
