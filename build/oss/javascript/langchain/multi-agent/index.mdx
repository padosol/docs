title: Multi-agent
sidebarTitle: Overview

Multi-agent systems break complex applications into coordinated components. **Importantly, "multi-agent" doesn't necessarily mean multiple distinct agents** — a single agent with dynamic behavior can achieve similar capabilities.

## Why multi-agent?

When developers say they need "multi-agent," they're usually looking for one or more of these capabilities:

- <Icon icon="brain" /> **Context management**: Provide specialized knowledge without overwhelming the model's context window. If context were infinite and latency zero, you could dump all knowledge into a single prompt — but since it's not, you need patterns to selectively surface relevant information.
- <Icon icon="users" /> **Distributed development**: Allow different teams to develop and maintain capabilities independently, composing them into a larger system with clear boundaries.
- <Icon icon="code-branch" /> **Parallelization**: Spawn specialized workers for subtasks and execute them concurrently for faster results.

Multi-agent patterns are particularly valuable when a single agent has too many [tools](/oss/javascript/langchain/tools) and makes poor decisions about which to use, when tasks require specialized knowledge with extensive context (long prompts and domain-specific tools), or when you need to enforce sequential constraints that unlock capabilities only after certain conditions are met.

<Tip>
At the center of multi-agent design is **[context engineering](/oss/javascript/langchain/context-engineering)**—deciding what information each agent sees. The quality of your system depends on ensuring each agent has access to the right data for its task.
</Tip>

## Patterns

Here are the main patterns for building multi-agent systems, each suited to different use cases:

| Pattern | How it works |
|--------------|--------------|
| [**Subagents**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/subagents) | A main agent coordinates subagents as tools. All routing passes through the main agent, which decides when and how to invoke each subagent. |
| [**Handoffs**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/handoffs) | Behavior changes dynamically based on state. Tool calls update a state variable that triggers routing or configuration changes, switching agents or adjusting the current agent's tools and prompt. |
| [**Skills**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/skills) | Specialized prompts and knowledge loaded on-demand. A single agent stays in control while loading context from skills as needed. |
| [**Router**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/router) | A routing step classifies input and directs it to one or more specialized agents. Results are synthesized into a combined response. |
| [**Custom workflow**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/custom-workflow) | Build bespoke execution flows with [LangGraph](/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview), mixing deterministic logic and agentic behavior. Embed other patterns as nodes in your workflow. |

<Note>
**Router vs. Handoffs — who decides?**

A key architectural distinction: in **Router** patterns, a central authority classifies user inputs and delegates to agents—agents are unaware of each other. In **Handoffs**, agents decide transitions themselves—agents are aware of each other and control when to hand off.
</Note>

### Choosing a pattern

Use this table to match your requirements to the right pattern:

<div className="compact-first-col">

| Pattern | Distributed development | Parallelization | Multi-hop | Direct user interaction |
|---------|:-----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:-----------------------:|
| [**Subagents**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/subagents) | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | — |
| [**Handoffs**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/handoffs) | — | — | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| [**Skills**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/skills) | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| [**Router**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/router) | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | — | ⭐⭐ |

</div>

- **Distributed development**: Can different teams maintain components independently?
- **Parallelization**: Can multiple agents execute concurrently?
- **Multi-hop**: Does the pattern support calling multiple subagents in series?
- **Direct user interaction**: Can subagents converse directly with the user?

<Tip>
    You can mix patterns! For example, a **subagents** architecture can invoke tools that invoke custom workflows or router agents. Subagents can even use the **skills** pattern to load context on-demand. The possibilities are endless!
</Tip>

## Performance comparison

Different patterns have different performance characteristics. Understanding these tradeoffs helps you choose the right pattern for your latency and cost requirements.

**Key metrics:**
- **Model calls**: Number of LLM invocations. More calls = higher latency (especially if sequential) and higher per-request API costs.
- **Tokens processed**: Total [context window](/oss/javascript/langchain/context-engineering) usage across all calls. More tokens = higher processing costs and potential context limits.

### One-shot request

> **User:** "Buy milk"

A specialized milk agent/skill can call a `buy_milk` tool.

| Pattern | Model calls | Best fit |
|---------|:-----------:|:--------:|
| [**Subagents**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/subagents) | 4 | |
| [**Handoffs**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/handoffs) | 3 | ✅ |
| [**Skills**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/skills) | 3 | ✅ |
| [**Router**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/router) | 3 | ✅ |

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Subagents">
    **4 model calls:**

        participant User
        participant Main Agent
        participant Milk Subagent
        participant buy_milk tool

        User->>Main Agent: "Buy milk"
        Note over Main Agent: Call 1
        Main Agent->>Milk Subagent: milk_subagent()
        Note over Milk Subagent: Call 2
        Milk Subagent->>buy_milk tool: buy_milk()
        buy_milk tool-->>Milk Subagent: Done
        Note over Milk Subagent: Call 3

        Note over Milk Agent: Call 3
        Milk Agent-->>User: "I bought milk for you"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key insight:** Handoffs, Skills, and Router are most efficient for single tasks (3 calls each). Subagents adds one extra call because results flow back through the main agent—this overhead provides centralized control.

### Conversational follow-ups

> **Turn 1:** "Buy milk"
> **Turn 2:** "Buy milk again"

The user makes a follow-up request in the same conversation.

| Pattern | Turn 2 calls | Total (both turns) | Best fit |
|---------|:------------:|:------------------:|:--------:|
| [**Subagents**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/subagents) | 4 | 8 | |
| [**Handoffs**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/handoffs) | 2 | 5 | ✅ |
| [**Skills**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/skills) | 2 | 5 | ✅ |
| [**Router**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/router) | 3 | 6 | |

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Subagents">
    **4 calls again → 8 total**

    - Subagents are **stateless by design**—each invocation follows the same flow
    - The main agent maintains conversation context, but subagents start fresh each time
    - This provides strong context isolation but repeats the full flow
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Handoffs">
    **2 calls → 5 total**

    - The milk agent is **still active** from turn 1 (state persists)
    - No handoff needed—agent directly calls `buy_milk` tool (call 1)
    - Agent responds to user (call 2)
    - **Saves 1 call by skipping the handoff**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Skills">
    **2 calls → 5 total**

    - The skill context is **already loaded** in conversation history
    - No need to reload—agent directly calls `buy_milk` tool (call 1)
    - Agent responds to user (call 2)
    - **Saves 1 call by reusing loaded skill**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Router">
    **3 calls again → 6 total**

    - Routers are **stateless**—each request requires an LLM routing call
    - Turn 2: Router LLM call (1) → Milk agent calls buy_milk (2) → Milk agent responds (3)
    - Can be optimized by wrapping as a tool in a stateful agent
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key insight:** Stateful patterns (Handoffs, Skills) save 40-50% of calls on follow-up requests. Subagents maintain consistent cost per request—this stateless design provides strong context isolation but at the cost of repeated model calls.

### Multi-domain

> **User:** "Compare Python, JavaScript, and Rust for web development"

Each language agent/skill contains ~2000 tokens of documentation. All patterns can make parallel tool calls.

| Pattern | Model calls | Total tokens | Best fit |
|---------|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------:|
| [**Subagents**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/subagents) | 5 | ~9K | ✅ |
| [**Handoffs**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/handoffs) | 7+ | ~14K+ | |
| [**Skills**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/skills) | 3 | ~15K | |
| [**Router**](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent/router) | 5 | ~9K | ✅ |

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Subagents">
    **5 calls, ~9K tokens**

    ```
    Call 1: Main agent (1K tokens)
      ├─ Calls 3 subagents in parallel
    Call 2: Python subagent (2K tokens) ─┐
    Call 3: JavaScript subagent (2K tokens) ├─ Parallel
    Call 4: Rust subagent (2K tokens) ─────┘
    Call 5: Main synthesizes (2K tokens)

    Total: 1K + 2K + 2K + 2K + 2K = 9K tokens
    ```

    Each subagent works in **isolation** with only its relevant context.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Handoffs">
    **7+ calls, ~14K+ tokens**

    ```
    Call 1: Main agent handoff to Python (1K)
    Call 2-3: Python agent researches (2-3 calls, ~2K each)
    Call 4: Handoff to JavaScript agent (included in Python's response)
    Call 5-6: JavaScript agent researches (2-3 calls, ~2K each)
    Call 7: Handoff to Rust agent (included in JS's response)
    Call 8-9: Rust agent researches (2-3 calls, ~2K each)

    Total: ~14K+ tokens across sequential handoffs
    ```

    Handoffs executes **sequentially**—can't research all three languages in parallel. Growing conversation history adds overhead.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Skills">
    **3 calls, ~15K tokens**

    ```
    Call 1: Load 3 skills (1K tokens)
      └─ Adds Python (2K) + JavaScript (2K) + Rust (2K) = 6K to context

    Call 2: Research (7K tokens)
      └─ Base (1K) + ALL skill contexts (6K) = 7K total

    Call 3: Synthesize (7K tokens)
      └─ Base (1K) + ALL skill contexts (6K) = 7K total

    Total: 1K + 7K + 7K = 15K tokens
    ```

    After loading, **every subsequent call processes all 6K tokens of skill documentation**.

    **The trade-off:**
    - Skills: ✅ Fewer calls (3) → ❌ Higher tokens per call (7K+)
    - Subagents: ❌ More calls (5) → ✅ Lower tokens per call (1-2K)
    - **Result:** Subagents processes 67% fewer tokens overall
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Router">
    **5 calls, ~9K tokens**

    ```
    Call 1: Router LLM analyzes query (1K tokens)
      ├─ Routes to Python, JavaScript, Rust agents
    Call 2: Python agent (2K tokens) ─┐
    Call 3: JavaScript agent (2K tokens) ├─ Parallel
    Call 4: Rust agent (2K tokens) ─────┘
    Call 5: Synthesis LLM combines results (2K tokens)

    Total: 1K + 2K + 2K + 2K + 2K = 9K tokens
    ```

    Router uses an **LLM for routing**, then invokes agents in parallel. Similar to Subagents but with explicit routing step.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key insight:** For multi-domain tasks, patterns with parallel execution (Subagents, Router) are most efficient. Skills has fewer calls but high token usage due to context accumulation. Handoffs is inefficient here—it must execute sequentially and can't leverage parallel tool calling for consulting multiple domains simultaneously.

<Warning>
**When to avoid Skills**: The Skills pattern is ideal for 1-2 lightweight skills. When you need many skills with extensive documentation (API references, detailed examples, comprehensive guidelines), use **Subagents** or **Router** instead. Context isolation prevents repeatedly processing accumulated documentation.
</Warning>
